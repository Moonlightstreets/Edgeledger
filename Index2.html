                  <h3>Reflection Of Good</h3>
                  <p>1) Steve Irwin was a man of many things, but mostly was his love for wildlife and nature.</p>
                  <p>2) He has given so much back to the world from just by being himself. Steve Irwin was a huge conservationist, and has spent most of his life teaching people the impotance of sustaining our wildlife and their habitatual ecosystems.</p>
                  <p>3) He has provided the world with many inovative ideologies that are even still used today. He was one of a kind, and truly loved what he did. He had purpose. </p>
                  <p>4) On September 4, 2006, Steve Irwin's has spent his last moments doing that in which he had loved. He had lost his life to a Stingray attack as he and his crew were filming their series named Oceans Deadliest. The incident had taken place along the Great Barrier Reef. </p>
